/** \file
 *  This C header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.2 Fedora release 15 (Rawhide) Tue Feb  8 02:02:23 UTC 2011
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : cqpTreeWalker.g
 *     -                            On : 2013-05-10 15:01:50
 *     -           for the tree parser : cqpTreeWalkerTreeParser *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise. 
 *
 * C language generator and runtime by Jim Idle, jimi|hereisanat|idle|dotgoeshere|ws.
 *
 *
 * The tree parser cqpTreeWalker has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 * 
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
 *
 * The parser entry points are called indirectly (by function pointer to function) via
 * a parser context typedef pcqpTreeWalker, which is returned from a call to cqpTreeWalkerNew().
 *
 * The methods in pcqpTreeWalker are  as follows:
 *
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->prog(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->query(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->within_containing(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->alignedpart(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->globcond(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->structure(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->bigseq(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->seqpart(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - FastStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->labeledpos(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - RangeStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->repeat(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - FastStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->onepos(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - FastStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->muquery(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *  - FastStream *      pcqpTreeWalker->mupart(pcqpTreeWalker)
 *
 * The return type for any particular rule is of course determined by the source
 * grammar file.
