Manatee-open-ucnk
=================

This is a fork of *Manatee-open* corpus management and query system.
It represents a slightly customized version as used in production 
by the Czech National Corpus. 

This project is intended mainly for use by the Czech National Corpus and 
unless you are looking for our specific modifications you probably want
to look at [NoSketch Engine page](http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske) where
you can download original and more recent versions of the software.
