Manatee-open-ucnk
=================

This is a fork of *Manatee-open* corpus management and query system.
It represents a slightly customized version as used in production 
by the Czech National Corpus. 

Please note that the *master* branch contains only an initial imported
code. To use a specific version used by one of our applications,
see a respective branch.

The project is intended mainly for use by the Czech National Corpus and 
unless you are looking for our specific modifications you probably want
to look at [NoSketch Engine page](http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske) where
you can download original and more recent versions of the software.
